# VLabs iOS Sample

The goal of this project is to develop a sample iOS application using swift's most commonly used libraries. The iOS application connects to a mocked backend provided by the [Jsonplaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) service. The libraries that I'm going to discuss here cover the most common tasks from networking to custom layout implementation. In this sample project, I will use some of the libraries discussed here.

## Libraries

The libraries can be categorized into three sections. First, the libraries that are purely related to [ReactiveX](http://reactivex.io/) ; you may want to check the link for more information about the API and its [operators](http://reactivex.io/documentation/operators.html) that handle asynchronous data streams through functional programming. Then, the libraries used for performing asynchronous http requests, downloading and caching, managing a local data store and building forms. Finally, the libraries related to custom layout implementation.

### ReactiveX

#### RxSwift

[RxSwift](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxSwift) is the implementation of ReactiveX for the swift programming language.

#### RxCocoa

RxCocoa is part of RxSwift. It provides a reactive API extensions to the user interface components of the Cocoa API.

#### RxDataSources

It's true that you could bind your Rx observables to your table and collection views using RxCocoa. However, you will need [RxDataSources](https://github.com/RxSwiftCommunity/RxDataSources) for the collection and table views that use sections by conforming your data objects to the `SectionModelType` protocol.

#### RxGesture

[RxGestures](https://github.com/RxSwiftCommunity/RxGesture) provides an API to the user interface's view object to respond to the user's gestures reactively.

### Network  

#### Moya

One of the common tasks involved in implementing iOS applications is to perform http requests to some provided web services. [Moya](https://github.com/Moya/Moya) helps you write your http requests in an abstract and a concise way. So, you won't need to keep on writing boilerplate code. For more information, check the library's documentation.

#### Moya-ObjectMapper

[Moya-ObjectMapper](https://github.com/ivanbruel/Moya-ObjectMapper) is used to serialize your Moya's API JSON responses to actual objects. So, you won't need to serialize your object from a JSON dictionary.

### Form Implementation

#### Eureka

[Eureka](https://github.com/xmartlabs/Eureka) is a library that helps you implement forms using a tableview under the hood. It provides custom operators to help you build your form and also provides a built-in validation API.

### Image Caching

#### Kingfisher

[Kingfisher](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher) is a library used to fetch and cache your downloaded images. In case you are an Android developer, it is similar to [Picasso](http://square.github.io/picasso/).

### Layout Implementation

#### LayoutKit

[LayoutKit](http://layoutkit.org) is an alternative to auto-layout that was implemented by LinkedIn for performance reasons. 

#### SnapKit

[SnapKit](https://github.com/SnapKit/SnapKit) is an API that helps you declare auto-layout constraints programmatically.

### Local Data Store

### Realm Mobile Database

[Realm mobile database](https://realm.io/products/realm-mobile-database/) is a very fast local database and it is an alternative to SQLite and Core Data.

### Theming

#### Chameleon

[Chameleon](https://github.com/ViccAlexander/Chameleon) is a flat color framework that helps you theme your iOS application easily.

## Conclusion

So, I hope that I was able to present the libraries in a concise and in an appropriate way. I encourage you to check the sample app to see an example of how some of these libraries work together. For more information, I suggest that you check the libraries' official documentation that I provided here.

Note: I believe that this is not the most appropriate architecture to build iOS applications. So, using an MVVM design pattern will be more appropriate.
